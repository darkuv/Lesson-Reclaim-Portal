# Lesson-Reclaim-Portal
This (school) project streamlines class attendance management, allowing timely unregistration for credits that can be utilized to catch up on missed lessons.

This was a school project for Bit Academy, my final project when I was studying there.
This is a website that could be used by a hobby school I was attending in the Hague. Because I am posting this project online and do not have the premission to use their house style, I used placeholder logos from https://logoipsum.com/ and created a similar housestyle for them that could possibly suit their identity.
At the end of the summer, some were arguing because there were no clear rules about making up for missed classes. That's why I had the idea to create a website where you can timely unregister for a class, which seemed to align well with what I learned in the Database PDO module at Bit Academy.

It works like this:

If you want to unregister too late, you will receive a message that it is no longer allowed.
If you want to make up for a lesson too late, it won't work either.
If you unregister in time, you will receive a credit, which you can use to make up for a lesson.
If you have 0 credits, it won't be possible to make up for anything.

There are only 2 lessons and 2 students in the fake database, easier for the reviewer.

The project may have limitations in terms of privacy and security, but it was the first PHP project that I ever made.
